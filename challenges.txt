Challenges & Decisions:
- Decided to use parameterized tests to make the tests more concise
- I was not sure how to do the palindrome test with RegEx until I learned about backreference
- I was having some difficulty figuring out how to implement the wordle guess generator with RegEx, but then we worked out the solution in class
